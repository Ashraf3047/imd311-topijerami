        <p style="text-align: justify;">Monkey D. Luffy, also known as "Straw Hat Luffy" and commonly as "Straw Hat", is the main protagonist of the manga and anime, One Piece. He is the founder and captain of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates, as well as one of its top fighters. His lifelong dream is to become the Pirate King by finding the legendary treasure left behind by the late Gol D. Roger. He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.</p>

          <div>Similar to most of his male crewmates, Luffy has the same outfit throughout most of the series (with the exception of Nami and Nico Robin, who frequently change their outfits). Luffy will often wear a different outfit to suit the climate of an island (such as a hooded parka on Drum Island or desert robes in Arabasta) but will switch back to his trademark red vest and blue shorts after the adventures on that island are over. Despite this, he will wear his usual outfit in different colors and has been known to sport other miscellaneous items on his person from time to time like in Thriller Bark and Sabaody Archipelago. According to Eiichiro Oda in 37 Volume SBS, Luffy does not know how to dress stylishly so sometimes he is advised on how to dress by more fashionable team members, Nami, Usopp, Sanji, and Robin.</div>

          <div>After those two years, a few things have changed. Luffy wears an open, long-sleeved red cardigan with four buttons (which shows the X-shaped scar covering most of his chest he received by then-Admiral Akainu), with a yellow sash tied around his waist, somewhat reminiscent of Gol D. Roger's outfit. He has grown slightly taller and is shown to be significantly more muscular due to his training. This can be seen in his slightly thicker neck, more pronounced deltoids, and better-defined chest. During his fight with Sanji, Luffy loses one of his top teeth after being struck by a Diable Jambe Joue Shot directly into his face. However, it grew back after he drank a bottle of milk.</div>

          <div> Luffy wore an open, short-sleeved shirt with a sunflower pattern, standard blue shorts, and a yellow sash. He also wore a fake beard. Upon entering the tournament for the Mera Mera no Mi in the Corrida Colosseum, he wore Viking-style armor, complete with a sword and shield until it was stripped from him due to a violation of the weight restriction. Upon revision to meet the weight restriction, he added a cape and wore the same Viking style helmet he wore previously, along with his registration number '0556' and the word "Lucy" written on the back of his shirt, obscured by his cape. When he recovered after his battle against Doflamingo, Luffy wore a red tank top along with his standard shorts in brown (dark grey in the anime).</div>

He also had a decorative scarf wrapped around his straw hat after landing at the Seducing Woods, though he appears to have lost it during his battle with Charlotte Cracker. These clothes were eventually torn to shreds after several battles and he later dons a new outfit to meet with Capone Bege; a red suit jacket with a brown shirt and a pink ascot along with red formal shorts. He also fitted a black fedora to the top of his straw hat.</div>

He also had the Nidai Kitetsu he borrowed from Tenguyama Hitetsu. Before beginning the assault on Onigashima, Luffy received a set of samurai armor from Hitetsu. When helping Kin'emon and the others against Kaidou's fleet at sea, Luffy wore a long, dark-colored coat over his usual attire. He also swapped his regular sash and pants for a purple and orange-brown one respectively. He also briefly wore a Beasts Pirates disguise (created by Kin'emon) when infiltrating Onigashima.</div>
